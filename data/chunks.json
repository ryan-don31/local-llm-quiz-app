    "text": "CSCI 3090 Mid Term Answers Muhammad Usman Faculty of Science Ontario Tech • 1 a [4 marks] How is colour represented in computer graphics? • Red, Green and Blue components of the pixel • 1 b [4 marks] What is a frame buffer? • A 2D array of pixel values • 2 a [6 marks] What is the difference between an attribute and a uniform variable? • An attribute variable changes on each new vertex • A uniform variable stays constant over a draw call, applies to many vertices • 2 b [6 marks] How are vertex coordinates passed to a vertex shader? • The vertex coordinates are copied to a array buffer • An attribute variable for the vertices is added to the fragment shader • CPU programs determines location of attributer variable and links it to the data in the array buffer • 3 a [8 marks] What data structures are used to store a polygonal mesh? • Vertex table and face table • Each entry in the vertex table contains all the information on a vertex, position, normal, etc. • Each entry in the face table contains the indices of the vertices for the polygon • 3 b [6 marks] What is an implicit representation of a curve or surface? What is the implicit representation of a circle? • Each point on a curve or surface satisfies f(p)=0, for some function f • The implicit representation of a circle is: 𝑥 −𝑐𝑥 2 + 𝑦−𝑐𝑦 2 −𝑟2 = 0 • 3 c [6 marks] What is the main difference between Cn continuity and Gn continuity? • With Cn continuity the derivatives on the two curve segments must be equal • With Gn continuity the derivatives just need to be proportional to each other, the same direction, but different lengths • 3 d [6 marks] Why are masters and instances used in hierarchical modeling? • Used when several objects have the same geometry • Master stores the geometry, instance points to the master • Advantages: • Easy to change geometry, just change the master and all the instances change • Saves memory, only one copy of the geometry • 3 e [4 marks] Why is local control an important property of a curve? • With local control changing a control point only effects a small part o the curve • Makes it much easier to modify or edit"

You do not need to multiply out the matrices. 100𝑥 010𝑦 001𝑧 0001 𝑠𝑥 000 0𝑠𝑦00 00𝑠𝑧0 0001 100 −𝑥 010 −𝑦 001 −𝑧 000 1 • 4 a [4 marks] What is the main difference between parallel and perspective projections? • Perspective projections produce realistic images while parallel projections produce images where lengths and angles can be accurately measured • 4 b [8 marks] What is back face culling? What is it used for? • Back face culling detects the polygons that are pointing away from the user, N dot V > 0 • It is used to reduce the number of polygons and pixels that must be processed • 4 c [6 marks] What is z fighting and how can it be avoided? • Z fighting occurs when the z coordinates of two polygons fall into the same bin in the z buffer, the z buffer doesn’t have enough resolution to distinguish them • Carefully set the near and far clipping planes to reduce the size of the z buffer bins • 4 d [6 marks] What are the three components of the Phong lighting model? • 2 marks each • Ambient light – background light level • Diffuse reflection – light scattered equally in all directions • Specular reflection – highlights, concentrated around the mirror reflection direction • 4 e [6 marks] What is the main difference between Phong specular reflection and Blinn-Phong specular reflection? • Phong uses the reflection vector and Blinn-Phong uses the half vector in computing specular reflection • 4 f [4 marks] What"
